## Hi, I'm Tim 👋  
Computer Science student focused on Java & practical software development

## About Me
  - 🔰 **Innovation is Key** - I have a hard time believing somthing is "impossible", so even if it takes a week to research and create that feature - i'll do it
  - 🎮 **Story Game Enjoyer** - At the end of the day, enjoying and exploring a world brilliant minds came up with, gives me a sense of pride of the Field i'm working in
  - 📖 **Learn to improve** - Besides the "you need to learn x to get to y" there is a whole world of your own interests out there. Learning about those feels like satiating the Soul
  - 🖼️ **Creating Art** - Handdrawn, Edited or Pixelart - creating something from thought is something i'll never get tired of (maybe taking a break after x retries of the same piece 💀)
  - 🎶 **Music** - Besides the Piano/Synth I'm part of a Rock Band and like to use FL Studio to get some Tunes out there (often EDM) - Music Taste through the bank

## Currently working on
  - 🟦 **Playrealm's New Dawn** – Minecraft MMORPG Server
  - 🔧 **MineBattle** - Custom Game Mode Plugin
