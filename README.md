## About Me
  - 👔 **Coding** - Started with Java in 2019, moved on to python, HTML/CSS and further Web dev. Self-tought and always trying my best to improve. **Never belive you know it all**
  - 🔰 **Innovation is Key** - I have a hard time believing somthing is "impossible", so even if it takes a week to research and create that feature - i'll do it
  - 🎮 **Story Game Enjoyer** - At the end of the day, enjoying and exploring a world brilliant minds came up with, gives me a sense of pride of the Field i'm working in
  - 📖 **Learn to improve** - Besides the "you need to learn x to get to y" there is a whole world of your own interests out there. Learning about those feels like satiating the Soul
  - 🖼️ **Creating Art** - Handdrawn, Edited or Pixelart - creating something from thought is something i'll never get tired of (maybe taking a break after x retries of the same piece 💀)
  - 🎶 **Music** - Besides the Piano/Synth I'm part of a Rock Band and also like to use FL Studio to get some solo Tunes out there - Music Taste through the bank
