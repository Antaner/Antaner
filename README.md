## Hi, I'm Tim 👋

### About Me
  - 🔰 **Innovation is Key** - I have a hard time believing somthing is "impossible", so even if it takes a week to research and create that feature - i'll do it
  - 🎮 **Story Game Enjoyer** - At the end of the day, enjoying and exploring a world brilliant minds came up with, gives me a sense of pride of the Field i'm working in
  - 📖 **Learn to improve** - Besides the "you need to learn x to get to y" there is a whole world of your own interests out there. Learning about those is like satiating the Soul
